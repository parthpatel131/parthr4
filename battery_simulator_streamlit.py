1. Cell Configuration

Add multiple cells with different types (LFP, Li-ion, NMC, LTO)
Customize initial parameters (voltage, current, temperature, capacity)
Randomize cell data with realistic values based on cell type
Real-time cell parameter display with professional cards
Individual cell management (randomize/remove)

2. Task Management

CC_CV (Constant Current - Constant Voltage): For charging operations
CC_CD (Constant Current - Constant Discharge): For discharge testing
IDLE: Rest periods between operations
Multiple tasks per cell with queue management
Visual task cards showing parameters and duration

3. Real-time Simulation

Live simulation with 1-second updates
Realistic battery behavior modeling:

CC_CV: Voltage rises during CC phase, current tapers in CV phase
CC_CD: Voltage drops during discharge
IDLE: Parameters stabilize toward ambient conditions


Real-time charts showing all parameters simultaneously
System status indicators and runtime tracking
